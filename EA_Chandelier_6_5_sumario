Overview of the Expert Advisor

Your EA, "Chandelier Robot V6-5," is designed for automated trading using the MetaTrader 5 platform. It employs technical indicators such as the Chandelier Exit and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to generate trading signals. The EA also incorporates position management strategies like increasing or decreasing position sizes based on certain market conditions.
1. Understanding the Standard Library Trade.mqh

Purpose: Simplifies trading operations by providing classes and methods to manage trades without dealing with low-level functions.

    Class CTrade: Encapsulates trading functions for opening, modifying, and closing positions.
    Methods Used:
        PositionOpen(): Opens a new position.
        PositionClose(): Closes an existing position.
        SetTypeFilling(): Sets the order filling type.

Key Points:

    Simplifies code by handling MqlTradeRequest and MqlTradeResult internally.
    Enhances code readability and maintainability.
    Provides error handling and management features.

2. Understanding struct in MQL5

Definition: A struct is a user-defined data type that groups related variables.

    Usage in Your Code:
        struct SINAL: Represents trading signals with boolean flags for actions like buy, sell, close_buy, and close_sell.

        mql5

struct SINAL {
   bool buy;
   bool sell;
   bool close_buy;
   bool close_sell;
};

struct SINAL_MOD: Represents signals for modifying positions, with flags for increasing or returning positions.

mql5

        struct SINAL_MOD {
           bool increase_position;
           bool return_position;
        };

Benefits:

    Organizes related data, enhancing code clarity.
    Facilitates data passing between functions.
    Simplifies maintenance and scalability.

3. The OnTester Function

Purpose: Used during strategy testing and optimization to calculate a custom metric.

Implementation in Your Code:

    Adjusts total profit by subtracting a fixed cost per stock trade.
    Helps in optimizing strategies by considering transaction costs.

Key Points:

    Function Signature: double OnTester()
    Usage:
        Selects trade history within the testing period.
        Counts the number of stock trades.
        Returns the adjusted profit.

4. The NewCandle Function

Purpose: Determines if a new candle (bar) has formed on the chart.

Functionality:

    Compares the timestamp of the current bar with the previous one.
    Considers timeframes and avoids signals during market openings (e.g., auction openings).

Implementation Details:

mql5

bool NewCandle(uint i) {
   bool IsNewBar = false;

   if (CopyTime(ativos[i], timeframes[i], 0, 2, NewTime) > 0) {
      if (OldTime[i] != NewTime[0]) {
         IsNewBar = true;
         OldTime[i] = NewTime[0];
      }

      // Checks for day change in lower timeframes
      MqlDateTime now;
      MqlDateTime last;
      TimeToStruct(NewTime[1], now);
      TimeToStruct(NewTime[0], last);

      if (((now.day - last.day) == 1) && (timeframes[i] <= 30)) {
         IsNewBar = false;
      }
   }
   return(IsNewBar);
}

Key Points:

    Prevents multiple executions within the same candle.
    Avoids operations during volatile periods like market openings.

5. The CheckSignal Function

Purpose: Analyzes indicators to generate trading signals.

Functionality:

    Indicators Used:
        Chandelier Exit: Determines trend direction.
        RSI: Confirms overbought or oversold conditions.
    Signal Generation:
        Buy Signal:
            Chandelier upper line is present.
            RSI is below the buy threshold in any of the last five periods.
        Sell Signal:
            Chandelier lower line is present.
            RSI is above the sell threshold in any of the last five periods.
    Closing Positions:
        Signals to close existing positions based on indicator conditions.

Implementation Details:

mql5

SINAL CheckSignal(int chand_handle, int rsi_handle, string ativo, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES time) {
   // Buffer declarations and copying indicator data

   // Initialize result struct
   SINAL resultado;
   resultado.buy = false;
   resultado.sell = false;
   resultado.close_buy = false;
   resultado.close_sell = false;

   // Buy condition
   if ((b_chand_upl[1] > 0) && (b_chand_dnl[1] == EMPTY_VALUE) &&
       ((b_rsi[1] < rsi_c) || ... || (b_rsi[5] < rsi_c))) {
      resultado.buy = true;
      resultado.close_sell = true;
   }

   // Sell condition
   if ((b_chand_dnl[1] > 0) && (b_chand_upl[1] == EMPTY_VALUE) &&
       ((b_rsi[1] > rsi_v) || ... || (b_rsi[5] > rsi_v))) {
      resultado.sell = true;
      resultado.close_buy = true;
   }

   // Close position conditions

   return(resultado);
}

6. Understanding Handles and Buffers

Handles:

    Identifiers for indicator instances.
    Obtained using functions like iCustom, iRSI, etc.

Buffers:

    Arrays storing indicator data.
    Accessed using CopyBuffer with the appropriate handle.

Usage in Your Code:

    Handles are stored in handles[].
    Buffers like b_chand_upl[], b_chand_dnl[], b_rsi[] hold indicator values.
    Data is copied and used to generate signals.

Key Points:

    Essential for interacting with indicators programmatically.
    Ensure data is up-to-date for accurate signal generation.

7. The CheckModSignal Function

Purpose: Determines whether to modify (increase or decrease) existing positions.

Functionality:

    Compares the current price to the Chandelier indicator lines.
    Uses thresholds (valor_aumento_posicao, valor_retorno_posicao) to decide actions.
    Returns a SINAL_MOD struct with flags for action.

Simplified Implementation After Removal of Unused Parameters:

mql5

SINAL_MOD CheckModSignal(int chand_handle, string ativo, ENUM_TIMEFRAMES time, bool posicao_comprada, bool posicao_vendida, double bid) {
   // Buffer declarations and copying indicator data

   // Initialize result struct
   SINAL_MOD resultado;
   resultado.increase_position = false;
   resultado.return_position = false;

   // Check conditions to increase or return position

   return(resultado);
}

Note: The atr_handle and related buffers were identified as unnecessary and removed for code optimization.
8. The CalculateLotsize Function

Purpose: Calculates the appropriate lot size for orders based on the asset type.

Functionality:

    Distinguishes between futures contracts and stocks.
    Adjusts the lot size to meet minimum volume requirements.
    Ensures compliance with broker specifications.

Implementation Details:

mql5

double CalculateLotsize(double price, int i) {
   // For futures contracts
   if (SymbolInfoDouble(ativos[i], SYMBOL_VOLUME_MIN) == 1) {
      lotsize = (uint)lotsizes[i];
   }
   // For stocks
   else if (SymbolInfoDouble(ativos[i], SYMBOL_VOLUME_MIN) >= 100) {
      lotsize = (uint)MathMax(floor((lotsizes[i]/price)/100)*100, 100);
   }
   else {
      lotsize = lotsizes[i];
   }
   return(lotsize);
}

9. The OnInit Function

Purpose: Initializes the EA, setting up indicators and preparing the trading environment.

Functionality:

    Sets up asset arrays and lot sizes.
    Obtains handles for the indicators used.
    Configures the trade object for order execution.

Implementation Details:

mql5

int OnInit() {
   // Initialize assets, timeframes, and lot sizes

   // Obtain handles for indicators
   handles[0] = iCustom(...); // Chandelier Exit
   handles[1] = iRSI(...);    // RSI
   handles[2] = iATR(...);    // ATR (if needed)

   // Set trade filling type
   trade.SetTypeFilling(ORDER_FILLING_RETURN);

   return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
}

10. The OnTick Function

Purpose: The core function that executes on every tick, managing the trading logic.

Functionality:

    Time Control:
        Ensures trading occurs only within specified hours.
        Closes positions outside trading hours.
    Main Loop:
        Iterates over assets.
        Checks for new candles before proceeding.
    Market Analysis:
        Obtains current price.
        Calls CheckSignal to get trading signals.
    Position Management:
        Checks if positions are open.
        Determines if positions need to be closed or modified.
        Executes trades based on signals and position status.

Implementation Details:

mql5

void OnTick() {
   // Time control logic

   for (int i=0; i<ArrayRange(ativos, 0); i++) {
      if (!NewCandle(i)) { 
         continue;
      }

      // Get current price
      bid_atual = SymbolInfoDouble(ativos[0], SYMBOL_LAST);  

      // Get trading signals
      SINAL sinal = CheckSignal(handles[0], handles[1], ativos[i], timeframes[i]);

      if (PositionSelect(ativos[i])) {
         // Position is open
         // Determine position type
         // Check if position needs to be closed
         // Check if position should be increased or returned
         // Execute position modifications
      } else {
         // No position is open
         // Check if new positions should be opened
         // Execute trade orders
      }
   }
}

Key Points:

    Position Types: Differentiates between buy and sell positions.
    Position Modification: Adjusts position size based on market conditions.
    Order Execution: Uses CTrade methods for trading operations.
